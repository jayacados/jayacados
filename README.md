Hi, I'm Jimmy (he/him)—a software engineer at ReactionTime working on a [Developer Tool](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/ReactionTime) to help engineers working with React's newest Concurrent Mode features. Previously worked at NASA Ames Research Center 🚀 and Disneyland Parks & Resorts 🏰, where I used code to ensure improve workflow and ensure workers are in a welcoming, safe, and productive environment. I currently live in sunnyside Los Angeles, CA and am a native to the area. I'm a public health specialist, nerd/geek/scientist, pet adoption advocate, opera fanatic and a board game afiocinado.

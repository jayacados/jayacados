# Jimmy H. Phong, MPH
Hi, I'm Jimmy (he/him)— a software engineer at Fashionphile. Previously worked at NASA Ames Research Center 🚀  and Disneyland Parks & Resorts 🏰, where I used code to improve workflow and ensure workers are in a welcoming, safe, and productive environment. I currently live in sunnyside Los Angeles, CA and am a native to the area. I'm a public health specialist, epidemiologist, amateur calligraphist, pet adoption advocate, opera fanatic and a board game afiocinado.

## My values
🌟 Expression as authentic self<br>
🍏 Beginner's mindset and curiosity<br>
🙌 Shared norms<br>
🚀 Elevate the underrepresented

## How I work
My motivation is to sharpen the axe in the honor of moving quickly when it's needed and matters most. A checklist paired with paper-drawn wireframes are an absolute favorite to get those neurons firing! ✅
